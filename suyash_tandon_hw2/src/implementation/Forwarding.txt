What is Forwarding?

Forwarding is a process that is used to remove the blank cycles that occur due to stall.
Whenever there is a stall, we check the resgiter for which the stall has occurred and we 
check where that particular register is in the pipeline currently and directly assign the value from there.
Thereby, getting rid of the balnk cycles and improving the performance of the code. 

For Ex:

MOVC R1 2
ADD R1 R1 1

Here, the MOVC instruction moves 2 in R1 in execute and ADD cannot use that untill the writeback stage is executed.
To resolve this, by using forwaring, we can get the value of R1 directly to the next instruction as a source thereby getting
rid of the blank cycles.
